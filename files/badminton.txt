Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.
It can be played as "singles" (with one player per side) or "doubles" (with two players per side).
Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
The shuttlecock is a feathered or plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports.
The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock.
Badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport since 1992.
The Badminton World Federation (BWF) is the governing body for the sport.
China, Indonesia, and Denmark are traditional powerhouses in international badminton.
The Thomas Cup (men) and Uber Cup (women) are major international team competitions.
Fast reflexes and excellent fitness are required to play badminton at a high level.
